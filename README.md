   - Excluding erroneous prices (`Unit Price < 0`).
2. Create visualizations to answer specific business questions:
   - **Time series of revenue for 2011**.
   - **Top 10 countries by revenue (excluding UK)**.
   - **Top 10 customers by revenue**.
   - **Product demand across countries (excluding UK)**.
